Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB we built a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "tokoSocial" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to make posts and get comments.

Setup:

- run `yarn && yarn start` for server to start the app
- run `yarn && yarn dev` for client to start the app
